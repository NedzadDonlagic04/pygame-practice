# pygame-practice

In this project I will be practicing the basics
of python's pygame library.
The game will be based on the one Clear Code
makes in his tutorial, but I will be adding
things to it to practice more skills I acquired
while learning how to use pygame.

I will be doing so while following the links
below:
